Hi! I'm an incoming PhD student at the [School of Informatics](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/) in the University of Edinburgh as part of the [MLSystems CDT studentship](https://mlsystems.uk/). I will be joining the [EASE lab](https://easelab.inf.ed.ac.uk/) under the guidance of [Prof. Boris Grot](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bgrot/) and [Prof. Luo Mai](https://luomai.github.io/). Previously, I did my Undergrad + Masters at the [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I worked on embedded systems for a variety of usecases with Prof. Aftab Hussain and Prof. Suresh Purini. 

My research interests majorly are in the domain of Computer Architecture, with a specific interest in memory systems and application-specific architectures like efficient systems for ML workloads. Memory systems are a massive bottleneck in modern computing, and I am interested in exploring ways to alleviate this, especially in the context of extremely large scale workloads like ML. With the rapidly increasing number of hyperscale workloads and increasing power requirements of the systems that are used to run them, I am also interested in exploring ways to make these systems more efficient, since even small efficiency gains can lead to significant power savings at scale. 

Specific areas that I'm interested in include effective data prefetching, hardware-software codesign, novel cache architectures and memory management techniques.
