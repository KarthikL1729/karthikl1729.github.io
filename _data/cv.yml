    - title: Visiting Research Student
      institution: School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh
      year: 2024 - 2025
      description:
      - Systematically analysed the impact of interleaving effects and co-located functions on the performance of different categories of serverless functions in a representative real-world serverless setting.
      - Designed and implemented an end-to-end pipeline to explore the architectural implications of large serverless workloads at scale.
      - Advised by Prof. Boris Grot, in collaboration with Dr. David Schall.

    - title: Student Researcher
      institution: CVEST, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad
      year: 2022 - 2025
      description:
        - Working on research projects involving embedded systems, sensor networks, noise analysis, flexible electronics under the guidance of Prof. Aftab Hussain.
        - Primarily worked on building low latency data collection systems which were used for collecting data towards driving data prediction tasks.

    - title: Student Researcher
      institution: Computer Systems Group, IIIT Hyderabad
      year: 2023
      description:
        - Worked on deploying ML models on resource constrained embedded platforms for image recognition tasks under the supervision of Prof. Suresh Purini.
        - Helped develop an end-to-end pipeline for real-time image recognition using YOLOv5. Used the ONNX runtime and offloading computations to specialised accelerator cores, by which we achieved sustained performance of 90+ fps with object detection.

    - title: Research Collaborator
      institution: UPC Barcelona
      year: 2024
      description:
        - Worked on analysing GPU architectures for Ray-Tracing applications using Vulkan-sim and Lumibench under the guidance of Prof. Antonio Gonzalez.
        - Identified bottlenecks in the ray tracing pipeline that can potentially be solved by specific architectural modifications for SIMD and RT units as well as cache hierarchies.

    - title: TPM Intern
      institution: Microsoft
      year: 2024
      description:
        - Worked with the Global Capacity Management team to plan, ideate and implement a new feature for the internal tool used for staffing.
        - The feature was aimed at improving the efficiency and ease of use for the requestors by providing real time feedback regarding the request specifications and suggesting similar matches based on availability using a random forest regressor.

    - title: System Software Development Intern
      institution: Texas Instruments
      year: 2023
      description:
        - Ported AM62x SoC to Zephyr RTOS from the proprietary SDK, wrote driver for proprietary RAT (Address Translation) module.
        - Modified drivers for UART and Pincontrol for supporting M4F core on the AM62x. All contributions have been merged and can be found in the upstream repository -- [Zephyr RTOS](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr).

    - title: Open Source Developer
      institution: Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation, Google Summer of Code
      year: 2022
      description:
        - Project under the Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation (FOSSi) - [Sootty, the CLI waveform viewer](https://github.com/Ben1152000/sootty).
        - Improved the temporal logic language that Sootty uses by implementing bitwise operators for multi-wire busses, adding a save flag to allow for a reusable query interface.
        - Added support for ready-valid handshake detection according to the AXI protocol.
